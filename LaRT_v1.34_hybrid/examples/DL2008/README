FINE_STRUTURE

This directory is to reproduce the results of DL2008 (Dijkstra & Loeb 2008).

   If the shell is too (geometrically) thin, the spectra given in DL2008 are not reproduced.
      A too thin shell gives narrower spectra than those given in DL2008.
   Do not use ../backup_f90/grid_mod_car_v1c.f90, which make a thinner shell.

   In this models, I will use grid_mod_car_v1c.f90.
